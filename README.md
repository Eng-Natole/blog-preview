This project is a blog preview card component designed using HTML and CSS.

🛠️ My Process
Built with
HTML5 - For the semantic structure
CSS3 - For styling and layout
Flexbox - For responsive design
Google Fonts (Figtree) - For typography
What I learned
This project helped enhance my understanding of CSS Flexbox for layout positioning and box-shadow for adding depth to UI elements. I also reinforced best practices in semantic HTML and hover/focus states to improve user experience.

One interesting trick I used was customizing the hover effect for the blog title:

css
Copy
Edit
.title a:hover {
color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
transition: color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
This ensures a smooth transition when hovering over the title.

Continued Development
Moving forward, I aim to:

Improve accessibility by ensuring better contrast and keyboard navigation.
Experiment with CSS Grid to see how it compares with Flexbox for similar card-based layouts.
Optimize the hover and focus states for a more interactive user experience.
